// Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull
// SORTING
// For example, companies that sell tickets for events and sports games such as Ticketmaster, SeatGeek or Ticket City,
// in order to implement queues for highly demanded events they have to sort the users by the time they requested the tickets
// so the firsts to be buying them will be the firsts that made the request.
// CONVEX HULL
// For instance, when you want to build a fence around a set of objects you'd want the convex hull to minimize the fencing used
