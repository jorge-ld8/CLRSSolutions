// QUESTION
    // Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strenghts and limitations.

// ANSWER
    // Linked lists 
        // STRENGHTS
            // - Unlike arrays uses the memory dynamically so it only occupies the storage it needs
            // - They can be ordered using the same algorithms as used in arrays
            // - Elements can be easily removed or reallocated.
        // LIMITATIONS
            // - They do not provide any form of efficient indexing, so operations like finding the last node in the list 
            //   may have to iterate over the whole list.
            // - They do not have an efficient way of accessing the date randomly
